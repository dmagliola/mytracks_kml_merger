# A KML file is a bunch of metadata (a header),
# then N timestamps, one per point in the recorded track (one per line in the file)
# then N coordinates, one per point (why these aren't next to each other is beyond me)
# then a footer closing all the opened tags.
# 
# Because every XML tag is in its own line, we don't need to parse the files as XML, 
# we can just read them line-by-line and count of the order being respected.
# 
# Thus, we can combine a number of KML files by taking the header of the first one, 
# the timestamps from all of them in order, then the coordinates for all of them in order,
# then the footer for the last one.
#
# We also need to modify the header a bit, to change the route name that will show in the app.
# 
# This works AS LONG AS all routes start where the previous one ended. Otherwise, there'll be
# a big straight line in the middle of the map.
#
# The way this script is used is just calling `merge.rb`, which will take all KML files in
# the `mytracks` folder, merge them all, and generate a new file in the root folder of this 
# repo with all the tracks in one. 

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reads the KML file line by line, not like an XML file, and splits it into sections:
# `header`: Everything before the first data point
# `timestamps`: All the timestamps for the route
# `coords`: All the coordinates for the route. Will be the same number of lines as `timestamps`
# `footer`: Everything after the last coordinate.
