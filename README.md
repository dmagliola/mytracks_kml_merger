# MyTracks KML Helper

Takes a bunch of KML files generated by MyTracks and merges them into
one.

1. Put your KML files into `./mytracks`
1. `ruby merge.rb`
1. take the `merged*.kml` file


## On the phone

- Go to Google Drive, select the file, and then "Copy to" (not "Download"). I don't know why...
